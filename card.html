      <p>He likes to go for walks, eats everything except dog food, follows everywhere you go and cuddles you everytime. He watches you in your sleep and even joins with his blanket on. He cries when you ignore him and is jealous when the attention is not
        in him. He is intensely loyal to his family and doesn't like being left out. You'll definitely find a companion like no other! </p>
